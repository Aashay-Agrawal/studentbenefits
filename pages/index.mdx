Hello and welcome to our open-source web app, **Student Benefits**, your gateway to a world of academic opportunities, valuable discounts, and essential tools! üåçüéì

We're excited to provide a platform that connects students with a variety of benefits, including academic opportunities, scholarships, internships, conferences, and discounted tools and products.

## About the Project

*Student Benefits* was created by [Saumitra Kapoor](https://github.com/kapoorsaumitra) in 2023 with the aim of establishing a collaborative repository of valuable tools and opportunities tailored for individuals across various paths within the tech industry.

Our platform serves as a dynamic hub where contributors from diverse backgrounds come together to curate resources that benefit the entire community.

This project is powered by [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/), a Next.js static site generator, and is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). We extend our gratitude to the teams behind Nextra and Vercel for providing the tools that enable us to create and share this platform with the world.
