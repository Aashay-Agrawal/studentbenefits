# Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Overview

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers university students the opportunity to work on open-source projects during the summer. The program provides stipends to students for their contributions, giving them a chance to gain real-world coding experience and make an impact in the open-source community.

## How GSoC Works

1. **Student Application:** Eligible students apply to participate in GSoC by submitting project proposals to selected open-source projects.

2. **Project Selection:** Projects review and select student proposals based on their feasibility, alignment with project goals, and potential impact.

3. **Coding Period:** Accepted students work on their projects during a specified coding period. They collaborate with mentors and the open-source community.

4. **Mid-term Evaluation:** Students receive feedback on their progress from mentors during the mid-term evaluation.

5. **Final Evaluation:** At the end of the coding period, students present their work, and mentors evaluate their contributions.

6. **Stipends:** Students receive stipends for their successful participation and contributions to the project.
